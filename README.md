### Introduction
*"This script helps users search for and display anime images from a dataset folder. It's interactive and user-friendly, allowing you to find specific anime folders and view images inside them."*

*"The script uses Python and requires the PIL library (or Pillow) to handle images. You’ll also need a dataset of anime images organized in folders by anime names."*

### Code Walkthrough

1. **Imports**  
*"First, we import the necessary modules. The `os` module helps manage file and folder operations. The `Image` class from the PIL library is used to open and handle image files. Finally, `display` from `IPython.display` is used to show the images interactively."*

---

2. **Dataset Path Validation**  
*"The function begins by checking if the dataset path exists. If the path is invalid, the script prints an error message and stops. This ensures we don’t run into issues with missing files."*

---

3. **Interactive User Input**  
*"The main part of the script is an infinite loop that keeps interacting with the user. Users can type 'Y' to search for an anime, 'N' to skip, or 'stop' to exit. This makes the script dynamic and user-friendly."*

---

4. **Anime Folder Search**  
*"When the user enters an anime name, the script constructs a path to the corresponding folder using `os.path.join`. It then checks if the folder exists. If it doesn’t, the user is notified to try again. Only valid image files—like JPG, PNG, or GIF—are considered, based on their file extensions."*

---

5. **Image Display**  
*"If the folder exists and contains images, the script counts them and asks the user how many they want to view. It validates this number to ensure it’s within the available range. Then, the images are displayed one by one using the PIL library."*

*"For example, the `Image.open` function loads the image, and `display` renders it interactively in the notebook or console."*

---

6. **Error Handling**  
*"The script includes error handling for invalid inputs. For instance, if the user enters text instead of a number, it prompts them to try again. This makes it robust and prevents crashes."*

---

### **Demo**

*"Here’s how it works: You provide the path to a dataset organized as folders, each named after an anime. Inside each folder are images of that anime. The script will search for the folder, count the images, and display the number you request."*

---

### **Conclusion**
*"This script demonstrates how Python can be used to create interactive tools. It handles user input, manages files, and displays images dynamically. It’s a great starting point for building more advanced applications, like a graphical interface or a web app for exploring image datasets."*
